I discovered [DiscordTimeStamper] through [this Reddit post] and immediately knew this could be turned into a website,
so here it is.

## Translation

New language contributions are welcome! They are handled through [Crowdin]. If you don't see your language listed,
[join our Discord server] and ask for your language to be added to the project in the [#translator-signup] channel. You
will be given the Translator role and granted access to a language-specific channel for further discussion. This is
necessary so that when new translations are needed for any potential new site features, I have an easy way to reach
everyone at once.

English and Hungarian translations have been included, so no translators will be needed for these two languages.
